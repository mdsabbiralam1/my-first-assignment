        <p>The business was started on 1939 by a cook named Haji Mohammad Hossain. After Haji Mohammad Hossain died
            in
            1992, his son, Haji Mohammad Golam Hossain took over and continued the family business without making
            any
            changes in style and tradition. By the passage of time Haji Mohammad Golam became tired by running the
            family business and finally handed over the business to his son, Haji Mohammad Shahed.</p>
