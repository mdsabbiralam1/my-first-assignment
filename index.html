            <p>The business was started on 1939 by a cook named Haji Mohammad Hossain. After Haji Mohammad Hossain died
                in
                1992, his son, Haji Mohammad Golam Hossain took over and continued the family business without making
                any
                changes in style and tradition. By the passage of time Haji Mohammad Golam became tired by running the
                family business and finally handed over the business to his son, Haji Mohammad Shahed.</p>
